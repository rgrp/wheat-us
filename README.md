US wheat production and prices time series from 1866 to the present. Data was
sourced from the US Department of Agriculture and converted into a more
machine-readable form.

The original data file (see resources) contains statistics on wheat—including
the five classes of wheat: hard red winter, hard red spring, soft red winter,
white, and durum—and rye and includes data at monthly, quarterly, and/or annual
depending upon the data series. However, the formatted data provides only
long-term annual data on the all wheat category.
